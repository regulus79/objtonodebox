# Obj To Nodebox

A script/mod for converting .obj files to minetest nodeboxes

## Usage

Run the python script `convert.py` with the argument being the path to your .obj file.

For example, run ```convert.py models/sample.obj```

This will output into the terminal a lua table which can be copied into a mod for use as a nodebox.
